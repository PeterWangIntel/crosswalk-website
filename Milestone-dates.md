# Crosswalk Milestone Dates

As described in the [Release Methodology](#wiki/release-methodology) 
page, Crosswalk follows a six week release cadence. The releases are 
frequently referred to as a ''Milestone'' release. Crosswalk 1.29.4.0 
maps to Milestone 1, Crosswalk-2.31.x.0 is Milestone 2, and so on.

When we talk about a feature landing by a particular milestone, the 
actual milestone is when the master branch of the source code is 
branched into its stabilization track.

The list below calls out the dates of upcoming milestones:

## Milestone 2: September 20, 2013

## Milestone 3: November 1, 2013

## Milestone 4: December 13, 2013

## Milestone 5: January 31, 2014
