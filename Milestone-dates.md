# Crosswalk Milestone Dates

As described in the [Release Methodology](#wiki/release-methodology) 
page, Crosswalk follows a six week release cadence. The releases are 
frequently referred to as a ''Milestone'' release. Crosswalk 1.29.4.0 
maps to Milestone 1, Crosswalk-2.31.x.0 is Milestone 2, and so on.

When we talk about a feature landing by a particular milestone, the 
actual milestone date is the time at which that feature will be present in a Beta release. Six weeks after that milestone date, the features for that milestone are (hopefully) stable and available to be 
included into the stable release.

Rebasing the Chromium/Blink occurs at the start of the milestone process. As such, the first few builds of a milestone cycle will typically be using the same Chromium release as the prior milestone. Once the rebase completes, the Chromium build number will in crease in the version string. For example, Crosswalk-2 started with Chromium 29 (same as Crosswalk-1), so the first few builds of Crosswalk-2 were crosswalk-2.29.x.y. Once the rebase completed, the Crosswalk version changed to crosswalk-2.31.x.y, signifying that release is built on Chromium 31.
