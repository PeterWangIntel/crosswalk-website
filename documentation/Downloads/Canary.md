The Canary release is generated on a frequent basis (sometimes daily) based on a recent tip of master that passes a full build and automatic basic acceptance test. The Canary build lets developers that are interested in the absolute latest features, and which donâ€™t want to build Crosswalk themselves, an easy option for working with the latest Crosswalk releases.
