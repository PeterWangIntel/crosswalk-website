# Samples
We have packaged up four simple applications to get you up and running with Crosswalk. These applications can be found in the archive <a href='https://origin-download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk-sapmles-0.1.tgz'>crosswalk-samples-0.1.tgz</a>.
```sh
tar xf crosswalk-samples-0.1.tgz
```
Decompressing that archive will create a samples subdirectory with three projects:
```
hello_world    A minimalistic example
webgl          Get up and running with WebGL in Crosswalk
tizen_apis     A sample application using the Tizen APIs
```
## Hello World
