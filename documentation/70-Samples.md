# Samples

We have packaged three simple applications to get you up and running with Crosswalk. These applications can be found in the archive <a href='https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk-samples-0.1.tgz'>crosswalk-samples-0.1.tgz</a>.
```sh
tar xvf crosswalk-samples-0.1.tgz
```
Decompressing that archive will create a samples subdirectory with three projects:
* **samples/hello_world** &ndash; A minimalistic example

* **samples/webgl** &ndash; Get up and running with WebGL in Crosswalk

* **samples/tizen_apis** &ndash; A sample application using the Tizen APIs

For information on each of the above samples, navigate via menu links.
