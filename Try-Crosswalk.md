Crosswalk is not ready for production application development, but if you'd like to try it, here are instructions for packaging your HTML5/CSS/JS application with a copy of the runtime. We humbly present an early milestone on the Application Runtime. This version is designed to be shared among multiple applications.  Except sharing isn't implemented yet as it's not possible to install it OS-wise. An early milestone- exactly.

_If you are a C/C++ developer and want to develop your own runtime built with Crosswalk, reference [Crosswalk Build Instructions](Build-Crosswalk) for instructions on how to build your own binary._

### Get Crosswalk Binary

You can download the pre-built binaries that are packaged into a .zip file (~30M) from:

https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk/releases

On Windows, the zip package contains:
 * Crosswalk launcher - xwalk.exe (~33M)
 * Crosswalk packaged resources - xwalk.pak (~5M)
 * Unicode and i18n support library - icudt.dll (~9M)
 * EGL/OpenGLES support libraries - libEGL.dll, libGLESv2.dll (~1M)
 * Installer creation script (.bat or .sh)

For a quick 'smoke test', unzip the file into a directory and try to run:

`xwalk.exe http://www.google.com`

You should see a native app window that renders the `www.google.com` page. Reference [Crosswalk Command Line Options](Crosswalk-Command-Line-Options) to see which options are provided by this early binary.

### Package Your Web App  
Given a web app written in HTML5 and Javascript with an `index.html` entry page, this binary allows you to package it into a native app installer.

You can also pack a manifest.json file with your application. Reference [Crosswalk manifest](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk/wiki/Crosswalk-manifest) to see how to write a manifest file.

#### For Windows Installer
The `create_windows_installer.bat` contained in the Crosswalk binaries is used to package a web app into a native app installer. 

A prerequisite for this installer is the Wix toolset. Download the toolset from http://wixtoolset.org/.

Run `create_windows_installer.bat --help` for instructions on how to use Wix.
```
usage: create_windows_installer.bat [options] [app_path]

The following options are supported:

app_path                Path to your Crosswalk application. If not specified, the
                          current directory is used.
--wix_bin_path=<path>   Path to Wix toolset binaries. If not specified, the
                          script will try to find them through PATH
--xwalk_path=<path>     Path to Crosswalk binaries. If not specified, the script
                          will try to find them through PATH, the app path, or
                          the current directory.
--app_name=<name>       Name of the application. If not specified, the name
                          of the application directory is used.
--version=<version>     The version of the application, defaults to 1.0.0
--app_arguments=<args>  Arguments that will be passed into Crosswalk executable.
                          If not specified, "index.html" is used. For example,
                          "--allow-file-access-from-files [INSTALLDIR]src/index.html"
--out=<pathname>        File Path of the output installer file, defaults to the
                          current directory with %app_name%.msi as its name.
--publisher=<name>      The manufacturer of this application, defaults to "Me"
--help                  Print this message
```

##### Example Usage
```
  create_windows_installer.bat webapps-scientific-calculator-master --wix_bin_path="C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.7\bin" --xwalk_path="C:\Users\username\Desktop\xwalk paking\xwalk-win32"
```

#### For Linux Installer
The `create_linux_installer.sh` contained is used to create native installer in RPM or DEB package format through [checkinstall](http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/) utility. You MUST install `checkinstall` firstly.  Run `sudo apt-get install checkinstall` on Linux system. 

The usage is similar with that on Windows, but without Wix:
```
usage: create_linux_installer.sh [options] [app_path]

This script is used to create a standalone installer for web app. It
depends on checkinstall and crosswalk to function properly.
The following options are supported:

     app_path                Path to your web application. If not specified, the
                               current directory is used.
     --xwalk_path=<path>     Path to Crosswalk binaries. If not specified, the script
                               will try to find them through PATH, the app path, or
                               the current directory.
     --app_name=<name>       Name of the application. If not specified, the name
                               of the application directory is used.
     --version=<version>     The version of the application, defaults to 1.0.0
     --app_index=<path>      Path of app index file, relative to app_path. If not
                               specified, index.html is used.
     --out=<path>            Path of the output package file, defaults to
                               /tmp/xwalk_build/<app_name>
     --publisher=<name>      The manufacturer of this application, defaults to Me
     --help                  Print this message
```

##### Example Usage
TBD

### Debug Your Web App
Crosswalk also enables remote debugging to a separate instance of a Chrome browser.

 * Step 1: Install Google's Chrome browser from www.google.com/chrome/â€Ž,
 * Step 2: Launch Crosswalk with remote debugging option `xwalk.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 index.html`
 * Step 3: Open `localhost:9222` in the Chrome browser, and you will see the inspectable pages in Chrome tab.
 * Step 4: Click the inspectable page to open the Web Inspector UI to start debugging.

### Known Issues
 * Network proxy set by environment doesn't take effect on Linux. Instead, you have to set the system wide network proxy.
 * Cannot play HTML5 video. It is because the ffmpeg library is not included in the Crosswalk binaries. Set Tips#1 for using ffmpeg to play HTML5 video in Crosswalk.
 * CSS3D and WebGL can not work on Windows if DirectX End-User Runtime is not installed on your system. Go to [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) to install DirectX End-User Runtime on your system.

### Tips
 1. How to enable multimedia in Crosswalk binary release?
 
 See [Enable Multimedia in Crosswalk](Enable-MultiMedia-in-Crosswalk)

 1. How to debug Javascript code in window.onload?

 Launch `xwalk.exe` with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, and open `localhost:9222` in Chrome browser to start debugging and set breakpoint inside `window.onload` body, press `F5` in Chrome to refresh the Web inspector page. As expected, your app will be paused at the breakpoint you set.

 1. How to specify the app icon?
 
 You can use `--app-icon` command line option or use favicon metatag inside `<head>` tag:
`<head>
 <link rel="icon" href="48x48.png">
 </head>`
