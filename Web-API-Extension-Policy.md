For different releases of Crosswalk we will be enabling additional web app facing API, such as part of the Chrome extensions API. Every time we need to know the difference between the current API in Tizen (which we - at least partly - need to support on Tizen) and the current SysApps WG work.

We need this in order to affect the work going on in the SysApps working group and we need to allocate someone to push our implementation in the working group.

Possible outcomes can be to convince Google to accept additions to their current API, like a few extra methods in app.window or it can be to try to change the current SysApps spec to be more like what is currently in Chrome.

Subpages should be added here to compare the current API's.
