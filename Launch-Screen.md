# Introduction

The launch screen is a static user interface that is shown immediately after the application is launched and is hidden when the application and required resources are loaded and the applicationâ€™s actual user interface can be constructed. The use of a launch screen leads to a better perceived performance and improves the user experience of an application as the user is able to see content relevant to the application immediately.
